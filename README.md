This assignment was focused on improving accessibility for Horiseon's website in order to optimize it for search engines and increase traffic. Here are some of the changes I made:

HTML (functional)
- new title "Horiseon | SEO Service"
- converting 'div' tags into semantic tags (i.e header, nav, section, article, footer)
- adding 'alt' attributes to images (accessibility)
- adjusting heading numbers (h1, h2, etc.) and class/id to be more logical
- fixing broken link by adding 'id' attribute to search-engine-optimization

CSS (aesthetic)
- rearranging order of tags/classes to match HTML
- combining properties into selectors (less unnecessary repetition)
